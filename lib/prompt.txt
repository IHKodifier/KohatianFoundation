ok lets start some pair programming. modify my UserAvatarOverlayChild so that 
it signs out the user on logout button
it navigates to the scaffolded ConsumerStatefWidget named AdminCenter. Then you will write code AdminCenter 
The AdminCenter is a Scafollded  Widget with a CustomScrollView in the body. slivers in the CustomSliverView include AppBarWidgetAdminCenterCore and SiteFooter
Next you will write the AdminCenterCore as a SliverToBoxAdapter whoose child grows and shrinks depending upon it contents 
The contents have three Cards for creation of an Entry model Class, EntryCoordinator  setting and other settings
rewrite the UserAvatarOverlayChild widgetElevatedButtons for Logout and AdminCenter are already there inside tge cards's trailing widget impement functionality on those ElevatedButtons
write an Adapation of AppBarWidget whichwill be a nonsliver version of the sliver based AppBarWidget. ignore the flexiblespacebar things. a simple adapatation of AppBar()
next up we are going to create the contents for createEntryCard, createEntryCoordinatorsCard and otherSettingsCard.give them suitable names. The content of CreateEntryCard is a Stepper widget of 3 steps. step has textformfields for entry_name, entrynumber,entry_trength(which is integer), start and endDate, entry_title(optional to fill), and entry_slogan(optional to fill). each step of the stepper has its own formkey so the entry cn be partially saved from data on each step. the step of the stepper has a button to create blank Cadets in the partially created entrydepending upon the number entered as  strength in step1. th second step will also droptarget fdor file drag n drop and an gesterdetecture to select an .xlsx file to create Cadets in the Entry. if .xls is provided,cadets cateated in th entry will not be blank but read from the excel file's rows and created in a sort of fromJson. all the cadets will be created in a cadets sub collection of the actual Entrys firestore document. the Entry will be crerated in entries top level collection of firestore
